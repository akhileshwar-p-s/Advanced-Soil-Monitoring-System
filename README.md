# Advanced-Soil-Monitoring-System
The system uses sensors and API data (e.g., soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rain, water level, wind speed, evapotranspiration and solar radiation) to monitor and manage irrigation time. Real-time data and predictive AI Model analysis allow precise water management. The system predicts with sensors and weather APIs data to prevent irrigation when rain is forecasted, conserving water.
